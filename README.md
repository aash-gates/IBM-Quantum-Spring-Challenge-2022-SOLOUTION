This year, we’re celebrating that enduring legacy with the IBM Quantum Spring Challenge, which will center on the very same ideas that inspired Feynman’s comments in the first place. Nature simulations may be the first and perhaps most-widely studied of quantum computing applications, but they also continue to be a source of near-constant innovation in the field, and are helping us make our way toward tackling some of physics’ deepest mysteries. 

The IBM quantum spring challenge 2022 had been divided into two segments. One part  invited participants to tackle problems revolving around many-body systems, while the other would focus on fermionic chemistry simulations.  Participants got a one-of-a-kind opportunity to investigate problems at the forefront of quantum computing researched. 
 
Each exercise was presented as a Jupyter notebook, which was hosted on the IBM quantum lab.
