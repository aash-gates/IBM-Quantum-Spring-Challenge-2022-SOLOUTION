This year, we’re celebrating that enduring legacy with the IBM Quantum Spring Challenge, which will center on the very same ideas that inspired Feynman’s comments in the first place. Nature simulations may be the first and perhaps most-widely studied of quantum computing applications, but they also continue to be a source of near-constant innovation in the field, and are helping us make our way toward tackling some of physics’ deepest mysteries.
